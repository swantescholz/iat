It's About Time
only 2 save slots (1,2 -> save, X/C reload from save spot?)
2D cave system, animated background?

a ball, sticking to the walls, shoot straight with mouse
currents, repulsors change direction
time slows to half, when aiming
after arriving at wall -> timeout of .24 seconds => better aiming required to spare time

always a timer running, continuously
timer can be reduced by collecting hourglasses (8 seconds each?)
levels seperated by blue doors with time limit
 - e.g. 2:33, after 2:33 the door closes
red doors: secrets (credits?), synchronisation, open after time limit exceeded

when blue door closes, player supposedly lost: timer red, "press 'r' to restart etc."
 -> hourglasses vanish (light from sourrounding crystals for different atmosphere?)
 -> hourglasses still there, invisible, with audio cues given
 -> player can still collect them (from memory), they then give like 18 seconds
 -> door may open again, player enters next level
 -> this process may either be explored early in the game by curious players or the
 -> player is forced to do that later in the game, since the normal extra time won't suffice
 -> to reach the door in time.


0:00 blue door in the start room, return at the end for credits and ending room?
red walls kill you -> restart from start of jump, or from last save?
multiple exits -> secret rooms?
level counter, exit counter?
property file -> map
long small tunner before exit, without hourglasses

TODO:
-double to float VBO, better performance?
-activate culling sometime
-timer on door, not HUD? -> font system
-normals rescale for light? -> shader fragment per pixel,
-all dark, single light
-gl error handling
-clocks
-save spots
